I wanna make a puzzle game with slippy slidey mechanics :))))

So when a player goes in one direction they slide until they hit a wall
Like that one Pokemon minigame but with co-ordinates based movements. 

In future versions I want to add things like:

-Make it so you can keep moving until you reach the end
-Add a number of moves made
-Add info about the size of the grid
-Add where you need to reach to win on the grid
-Add info on where you are on the grid after each turn
-Look into making some kind of high score board....?
